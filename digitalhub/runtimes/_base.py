    Base Runtime class for executing tasks in the DigitalHub platform.

    Runtimes are the entities responsible for the actual execution
    of a given run. They are highly specialized components which
    can translate the representation of a given execution as expressed
    in the run into an actual execution operation performed via
    libraries, code, external tools etc.
